--------------------------------------------------------------------------

About Me
++++++++

* I've worked on lots of things:
  - Galaxy dynamics
  - Variable stars
  - Photometric self-calibration
  - Image modeling: fast and traditional
  - MCMC sampling techniques
* Underlying it all: data analysis (preferably probabilistic)
